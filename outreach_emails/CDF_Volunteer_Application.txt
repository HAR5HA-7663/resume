Subject: Volunteer Application - AI/ML Engineer for Green Technology Initiatives

Dear Human Resources Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Harsha Vardhan Yellela, and I am a recent Master of Science in Computer Science graduate from Lawrence Technological University in Michigan. I came across Community Dreams Foundation while exploring organizations working at the intersection of technology and community development, and I was excited to learn about your mission to empower underserved communities through clean energy and advanced technology solutions.

Your Green Connect App and Green Collar Jobs program particularly caught my attention. As someone with hands-on experience building AI-powered applications and machine learning pipelines, I believe I can make meaningful contributions to your technology initiatives. During my graduate research, I developed multi-agent AI systems using LangChain and CrewAI, built RAG pipelines with vector databases, and deployed scalable services on AWS. I am also proficient in Python, FastAPI, and cloud infrastructure, which I understand aligns well with the technical work at CDF.

I am currently on F-1 OPT status and am looking to volunteer my skills while contributing to a cause I genuinely care about. I am available to start immediately and can commit to a consistent schedule, whether remote or on-site. I am happy to support your team with AI/ML development, data engineering, app development, or any other technical needs.

I have attached my resume for your reference. Please let me know if there are any current or upcoming volunteer opportunities where I could contribute. I would also be grateful if you could provide a volunteer offer letter confirming my role, as this is required for my immigration documentation.

Thank you for your time and for the impactful work Community Dreams Foundation does. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your mission.

Best regards,

V Harsha Vardhan Yellela
