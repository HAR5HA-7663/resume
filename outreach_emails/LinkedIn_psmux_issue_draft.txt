Just spent an hour debugging why I couldn't detach from psmux while running Claude Code inside it.

The problem: I wanted to run Claude Code in a persistent terminal session on Windows so I could detach and come back later while it keeps working on long tasks (like browser automation with Chrome).

psmux is a Windows-native tmux alternative that seemed perfect for this. But here's what I ran into:

1. The default prefix key is Ctrl+B, same as tmux. But Claude Code captures this keystroke before psmux can see it. Can't detach.

2. Tried changing the prefix key in ~/.psmux.conf to Ctrl+] but it didn't work. Config file parsing seems incomplete in v0.1.0.

3. Even when I could detach earlier, the server process died instead of staying alive in the background. Classic daemonization issue on Windows.

The obvious answer is "just use tmux in WSL" but that breaks the Chrome MCP integration since Claude needs to control a Windows Chrome browser, not a Linux one.

For now there's no clean solution. Windows still lacks a reliable terminal multiplexer that plays nice with modern CLI tools.

Anyone else running into this? Or found a workaround I'm missing?
