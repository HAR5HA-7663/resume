## 7. Sample Screening Questions & Answers

### Cloud & AWS Questions

**Q: Describe your experience with AWS cloud services.**
> I have 3+ years of hands-on AWS experience across compute, storage, and ML services. At Infor, I integrated AWS S3, Lambda, and API Gateway for enterprise clients like Ferrari and Boeing, building asynchronous file transfer pipelines. At Lawrence Tech, I deployed persistent backend services on AWS Fargate and Amazon EKS with OpenSearch Serverless for semantic search. I've worked extensively with DynamoDB for NoSQL data modeling, SageMaker for ML training and deployment, and used Terraform/CloudFormation for infrastructure as code. My Lambda Microservices project involved deploying 94 serverless functions with Stripe, Twilio, and QuickBooks integrations.

**Q: Do you have experience with Terraform or Infrastructure as Code?**
> Yes, I have practical experience with Terraform and CloudFormation. For my ML Sentiment Feedback Loop project, I used Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure including ECS Fargate clusters, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, and API Gateway. I've also used AWS CDK and CloudFormation for SageMaker ML pipelines. I follow IaC best practices including version control, modular templates, and state management.

### DevOps & Kubernetes Questions

**Q: Describe your experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration.**
> I've deployed production Kubernetes workloads on AWS EKS. For my Telegram Toxicity Moderator project, I designed a K8s architecture handling 500 RPS average with 1500 RPS peak capacity. I implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with multi-metric scaling, circuit breaker patterns (5 failures, 10s recovery), and comprehensive health monitoring with readiness/liveness probes. I configured Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring, achieving 70% cost reduction using spot instances and aggressive scale-down policies.

**Q: What CI/CD tools have you worked with?**
> I have hands-on experience with Jenkins and GitHub Actions. For my Online Learning Portal project, I implemented Jenkins Multibranch Pipelines with branch-per-service CI strategy for 6 microservices, enabling independent Docker builds with semantic tagging. I also use GitHub Actions for automated testing, Docker image builds, and deployment to AWS ECS/ECR. I'm familiar with deployment strategies including blue-green and rolling updates.

### Machine Learning Questions

**Q: Describe your machine learning experience.**
> I have experience across the full ML lifecycle - from data preprocessing to model deployment. Projects include: (1) Fine-tuning Qwen3-4B using QLoRA with 4-bit NF4 quantization for resume optimization, achieving 9.5/10 quality scores; (2) Building an 8-microservice MLOps platform with SageMaker for automated model retraining; (3) Pneumonia detection using VGG19 transfer learning on AWS SageMaker; (4) LSTM-based sentiment-driven market forecasting combining Reddit sentiment with financial indicators. I'm proficient with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and HuggingFace Transformers.

**Q: Do you have experience with LLMs and AI agents?**
> Yes, I work extensively with LLMs and AI agents. As a Graduate Research Assistant, I built and compared no-code (n8n) vs. coded multi-agent systems (CrewAI + LangChain MCP) for workflow automation. I've integrated GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and open-source models like Qwen and LLaMA into production applications. My CRE Research Agent uses RAG with vector databases (Qdrant, pgvector), embeddings, and reranking for academic literature review. I've also fine-tuned LLMs using QLoRA and PEFT for domain-specific tasks.

### Backend/API Questions

**Q: Describe your backend development experience.**
> I've built production APIs in Python (FastAPI, Flask), Go (Gin), and Node.js. My Job Portal API includes 25+ HATEOAS-compliant endpoints with OpenAPI documentation, deployed to AWS ECS. The FieldFuze Backend in Go features multi-tenant RBAC architecture with JWT authentication and DynamoDB. At Infor, I developed modular tools for Ferrari, Boeing, and Triumph by extending ERP workflows. I follow best practices including input validation, proper error handling, API versioning, and comprehensive documentation.

**Q: What databases have you worked with?**
> I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL: PostgreSQL and SQLite for relational data with complex queries. NoSQL: DynamoDB for high-throughput workloads with GSI/LSI indexing, MongoDB for document storage. Vector databases: Qdrant and pgvector for semantic search and RAG applications. I'm experienced with database design, indexing strategies, and query optimization.

### Compliance & Regulated Environments

**Q: Do you have experience in regulated environments (HIPAA, SOC 2)?**
> While I haven't worked directly in healthcare-regulated environments, I've implemented security best practices in enterprise contexts. At Infor, I worked with global clients (Ferrari, Boeing, Triumph) where data security was critical. I've implemented IAM policies, VPC configurations, encrypted data storage (S3 SSE, DynamoDB encryption), audit logging, and role-based access control. I'm eager to learn industry-specific compliance standards and apply my strong security foundation to meet regulatory requirements.

### System Design & Scalability

**Q: Tell us about a time you designed or supported high-availability systems.**
> For my Telegram Toxicity Moderator (Kubernetes-based ML platform), I designed a high-availability architecture handling 500 RPS average with 1500 RPS peak capacity. Key implementations included: circuit breaker patterns (5 failures, 10s recovery window) with readiness/liveness probes, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with aggressive scale-down policies, Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring, and spot instances for 70% cost reduction. Similarly, my ML Sentiment Feedback Loop deployed 8 microservices on AWS ECS Fargate with API Gateway, implementing auto-deployment pipelines with SNS notifications.

### Programming & Problem Solving

**Q: What programming languages are you proficient in?**
> My primary languages are Python, Go, and TypeScript/JavaScript. Python is my strongest language with 5+ years of experience across web development (FastAPI, Flask), ML/AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and automation. I've been working with Go for over a year, building production APIs with Gin and DynamoDB. TypeScript is my choice for frontend and React Native mobile development. I'm also comfortable with SQL, Bash scripting, and have experience with Dart (Flutter).

**Q: How many years of professional experience do you have?**
> I have approximately 3 years of professional experience. I worked as an LN Technical Consultant at Infor from April 2022 to December 2023 (1 year 9 months), developing enterprise tools for global clients. Since January 2025, I've been a Graduate Research Assistant at Lawrence Technological University, building agentic AI systems and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, I've completed 27 substantial projects covering ML/AI, backend development, DevOps, and full-stack applications.
